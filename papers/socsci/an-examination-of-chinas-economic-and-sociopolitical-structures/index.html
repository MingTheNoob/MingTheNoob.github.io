                                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The portrayal of the People's Republic of China in Western media is characterised by complexity and difficulty in
                                    comprehension. The deliberate intention to obfuscate the essence of the People's Republic of China and its governing
                                    political entity, the Communist Party of China, is evident. Although the sociopolitical-economic structure of a nation
                                    may entail unfamiliar terms and concepts, comprehending the functioning of a country is relatively straightforward. The
                                    economic system of the People's Republic of China is frequently characterised as "state capitalist", while its political
                                    system is often described as "authoritarian", and its social structure is commonly viewed as "oppressive". The only
                                    assertion made that can be true is that the People's Republic of China is characterised by an authoritarian form of
                                    governance. It is worth noting, however, that the term "authoritarian" may not necessarily represent the commonly held
                                    connotations associated with it. The present terminology appears to be comparatively less elaborate and comprehensive
                                    than what is commonly portrayed in Western discourse. For a state to be classified as authoritarian, it suffices to
                                    possess a certain degree of authority. This would encompass all sovereign states present on the Earth. Although there
                                    may exist variations in the degree of authority among nations, there is no compelling rationale to suggest that the
                                    People's Republic of China possesses a level of authority that warrants demonisation and political subversion by its
                                    Western adversaries. The Western powers, while vociferously asserting the legitimacy of the People's Republic of China,
                                    have themselves projected their own authority beyond their territorial boundaries, even penetrating the territory of the
                                    adversary they had previously vilified on the very same grounds. This is evident in the instances of Xinjiang, Tibet,
                                    Hong Kong, and Taiwan. It is evident that the prevailing perception of the sociopolitical and economic frameworks of the
                                    People's Republic of China (PRC) is not comprehensively grasped by a majority of Western individuals. This is primarily
                                    due to the limited and biassed information disseminated about the PRC, which is intended to promote negative sentiments
                                    towards the nation.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Understanding the Economics of the PRC</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The economic system of the People's Republic of China has commonly been characterised as "state capitalist." The
                                    discourse typically pertains to the state's ownership of pivotal and indispensable industries, in contrast to
                                    privately-owned industries under the purview of capitalists. It is crucial to comprehend that the presence of private
                                    enterprise within the People's Republic of China does not suffice to define the comprehensive economic landscape of the
                                    PRC. As a state governed by a Marxist political entity, it is inherently obligated to achieve socialism through a
                                    gradual and progressive process while simultaneously ensuring the safety and well-being of its populace. It is
                                    imperative to acknowledge that a nuanced perspective is necessary when examining the feasibility of socialism as a
                                    comprehensive system. Incremental cultivation is a fundamental prerequisite for the successful implementation of
                                    socialism. The existence of a global economic hegemony under capitalist principles would effectively preclude such an
                                    outcome. Numerous historical instances in West Africa, Russia, Western Europe, and other regions have demonstrated the
                                    veracity of this assertion. Despite the presence of private enterprise in the People's Republic of China, the socialist
                                    character of the party endures through its implementation of diverse policies and periodic 5-year plans, which
                                    consistently advance the country towards a more comprehensive manifestation of socialism. The contemporary economic
                                    landscape can be characterised as a hybrid economy, wherein a communist party exerts significant political influence.
                                    The aforementioned statement provides a precise outline of the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism, which is an
                                    ideology that encompasses diverse mechanisms of economic, social, and political nature. As clarified in the paper titled
                                    "How to Define Socialism", the manifestation of socialism varies based on distinct ideological orientations. The
                                    economic system of the PRC can be classified as socialist, albeit with the caveat that the extent to which socialism is
                                    implemented may not have been fully actualized. This stands in opposition to the political ideology of other
                                    left-leaning individuals, such as anarchists, who espouse a desire for a more expeditious realisation of socialist
                                    principles.
                                </p>
                                <h3>The PRC&apos;s Political Effect on Economics</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Over the past 70 years exactly, the PRC has been involved in countless political activities ranging from the development
                                    of its democracy structure to the social programs enacted by the Communist Party of China (CPC). The CPC alone has
                                    nearly 100 million party members coming from very diverse and differing backgrounds, all responsible for various
                                    political responsibilities. The advancements in various fields, such as healthcare, public housing, and technology, has
                                    allowed hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens to live comfortable lives whilst having plenty of work opportunities.
                                    As many know already, the communist party has been dedicated to various measures to combat climate change. For those who
                                    choose to not believe this, for reasons such as China’s increased coal usage or continuous production of electric
                                    vehicles, consider that despite China’s increased coal usage, they have also severely decreased the amount of exported
                                    coal. And despite the high production of electric vehicles, the rail network within China remains worldclass. Not to
                                    mention that every Chinese city and town is easily walkable or bikeable for those without automobiles. The CPC has also
                                    been involved in various other projects such as reforestation, solar energy, advancements in nuclear fusion technology,
                                    among many others. As can be seen, the CPC has had an immense impact on the workfield and the overall economics of the
                                    PRC leading to vast amounts of economic growth over the past few decades.

                                <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The Communist Party of China's economic orientation is, in actuality, socialist in nature. The structure in question
                                    does not conform to the characteristics of a "state capitalist" system. The aforementioned points are readily
                                    discernible through the diverse policies and updates pertaining to social benefits that are consistently implemented by
                                    the CPC. Although there has been some improvement in these challenges, they have not yet been fully resolved. Numerous
                                    issues persist within the People's Republic of China. Whilst it is true that the resolution of these issues is
                                    contingent upon the continued success of the CPC, it is important to acknowledge that the attainment of this objective
                                    will require a significant amount of time.
