                                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Socialism has been the subject of diverse definitions since its inception.
                                    Regrettably, individuals in positions of
                                    power have utilised the term in a manner that aligns with their political agendas.
                                    As a result, a plethora of
                                    occurrences of anti-socialist propaganda have transpired throughout the annals of
                                    time, resulting in a significant
                                    number of individuals being misinformed regarding the authentic definition of
                                    socialism. The National Socialist German
                                    Workers' Party, commonly known as the Nazis, strategically adopted the term
                                    "socialist" into their party name as a means
                                    of gaining popular backing. However, once they ascended to power, they vehemently
                                    denounced socialists and deemed them
                                    as their primary adversaries. Likewise, the United States utilises the term
                                    socialism as a means of vilifying its
                                    opponents, with the aim of galvanising public sentiment and rationalising potential
                                    military interventions. However, it
                                    is noteworthy that both of these entities have inaccurately characterised socialism.
                                    Similar to several other political
                                    and economic terminologies, the definition of socialism fluctuates depending on
                                    one's perspective. The variance in
                                    viewpoints observed is not necessarily attributable to political leanings, but
                                    rather to the influence of leftist
                                    ideology. This is due to the fact that socialism, which is a leftist ideology, is
                                    not present within right-wing economic
                                    ideologies. This is contrary to popular misconceptions, particularly in the context
                                    of social democracies.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Defining Leftism</h3>
                                <p>
                                    In order to fully grasp the concept of socialism, it is imperative to first
                                    understand the differentiation between
                                    economic left-wing and right-wing ideologies. The prevalence of restrictive
                                    educational backgrounds among individuals
                                    has led to a common misinterpretation of the definitions of these terms. It is of
                                    paramount importance to acknowledge
                                    that the ideological orientations of leftism and rightism exhibit variability
                                    contingent upon the particular domain of
                                    inquiry, be it economics, sociology, or politics. The term socialism pertains to a
                                    social arrangement of the economy,
                                    thus the economic definition is the applicable one in this context. In isolation,
                                    socialism does not provide any insight
                                    into the nature of society or the social conduct of its members. Nevertheless, the
                                    economic structure of a regime can
                                    exert a substantial influence on its social fabric. A comprehensive understanding of
                                    socialism necessitates a grasp of
                                    the concepts of economic leftism and rightism.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Throughout history, the fundamental principles of economic leftism have remained
                                    consistent, resulting in a certain
                                    degree of homogeneity in its appearance over time. The term "leftism" may be
                                    considered a recent addition to the lexicon
                                    of political discourse, however, the underlying objective of economic leftism, which
                                    seeks to establish an economy that
                                    is both democratic and collectively managed, has a historical lineage predating the
                                    coining of the term. The ideology of
                                    economic leftism has historically prioritised the collective distribution of
                                    economic power, rather than its
                                    concentration among the upper echelons of the socioeconomic hierarchy.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The concept of economic rightism is readily definable; however, it is important to
                                    acknowledge that throughout history,
                                    economic rightism has manifested in diverse forms as the ruling class has
                                    endeavoured to preserve a structure that
                                    favours their interests, even if it necessitates the establishment of a novel
                                    system. Over the course of the last few
                                    millennia, the dominant classes of diverse societies have implemented a range of
                                    economic frameworks, including but not
                                    limited to feudalism, slavery, and capitalism. The fundamental tenet of right-wing
                                    economies is predicated on the notion
                                    that individuals labour for the benefit of the wealthy class, while the labourer is
                                    remunerated with a nominal
                                    proportion of the actual value of their work. This phenomenon is observable across
                                    the historical epochs of feudalism,
                                    slavery, and capitalism. Among the tripartite economic systems, capitalism affords
                                    the labourer the highest degree of
                                    retention of the value of their labour, albeit the magnitude of this proportion is
                                    conventionally modest. Capitalism is
                                    extolled in the western world for this particular rationale. It is imperative to
                                    avoid deception, as the labourer
                                    continues to be subject to exploitation. Despite the reduction in the extent of
                                    expropriation, capitalism persists as a
                                    right-leaning economic framework. This principle serves as the governing force
                                    behind all right-wing economies.

                                <h3>What is Social Democracy?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Social democracy is a sociopolitical framework that is often categorised as a form
                                    of socialism. This assertion is
                                    untenable since socialism is fundamentally an economic paradigm. The term "social
                                    democracy" is conventionally applied
                                    to nations that exhibit social liberalism and progressivism, and possess a political
                                    framework that facilitates the
                                    realisation of democratic outcomes that are advantageous to the populace. Numerous
                                    nations, including socialist states
                                    such as Cuba and China, as well as those within the European Union, satisfy the
                                    aforementioned criteria. It is
                                    noteworthy that the nomenclature of social democracies is not extended to socialist
                                    states, as the term is exclusively
                                    reserved by the Western powers for nations that are in alignment with their most
                                    dominant states. It is evident that two
                                    regions characterised by markedly distinct economic structures, namely the European
                                    Union and China, may both be
                                    classified as social democracies. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that solely one of
                                    them can be categorised as
                                    socialist. The ideology of economic rightism enables the elite class to maintain
                                    their dominant status and exert an
                                    excessive degree of influence over societal and governmental affairs, beyond what
                                    may be deemed appropriate for any
                                    single individual. The coexistence of sociopolitical power and economic power within
                                    the wealthy class has historically
                                    enabled the utilisation of the former to maintain the latter's economic status.
                                    Social democracy is focused on altering
                                    the existing sociopolitical paradigm to promote greater equality for the average
                                    individual, while socialism is
                                    primarily concerned with modifying the economic mechanisms of a society to
                                    facilitate a more equitable distribution of
                                    wealth.

                                <h3>Defining Socialism</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Having established socialism as an economic system, it is now imperative to delve
                                    further into its nuances and examine
                                    its manifestations across various systems. Given that economic leftism entails a
                                    democratic and collectively managed
                                    economy, it follows that all forms of economic leftism encompass socialism. In broad
                                    terms, socialism can be
                                    characterised by three distinct manifestations. The initial approach, commonly
                                    embraced by anarchists, involves a
                                    revolutionary uprising aimed at the immediate establishment of communism. In
                                    theoretical terms, anarchists are inclined
                                    to adopt a comprehensive or all-encompassing variant of socialism immediately after
                                    revolution. Marxist ideology
                                    advocates for the utilisation of socialism as a gradual and incremental mechanism to
                                    facilitate the groundwork for the
                                    eventual establishment of communism. Certain adherents of Marxist ideology seek to
                                    attain their objectives through
                                    insurrection, while others advocate for legislative reform as a means to achieve
                                    their goals. The additional
                                    distinctions between Marxism and anarchism, as well as between revolution and
                                    reformation, are deemed extraneous to the
                                    present discourse and will be expounded upon in a subsequent paper.
                                </p>
                                <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The aforementioned terms have been distinguished as possessing straightforward and
                                    readily comprehensible concepts. It
                                    is imperative to comprehend that the semantic nuances of these terms are subject to
                                    variability owing to multifarious
                                    factors. Hence, it is crucial to redirect our focus towards a more rudimentary
                                    examination of socialism. A
                                    straightforward concept that can be comprehended by a broad range of individuals
                                    from the working class who may have
                                    been influenced by Western ideological thinking. There exists a common
                                    misapprehension among individuals regarding the
                                    tenets of socialism, which often leads to the misapplication of labels to various
                                    locales. Examples of economic labels
                                    applied to different regions include state capitalism for China and socialism for
                                    the European Union. However, these
                                    designations are merely inaccurate classifications assigned to these countries. The
                                    democratic organisation of the EU's
                                    economy by the collective is lacking. While capitalists are permitted to engage in
                                    commercial activities within China,
                                    the Communist Party of China (CPC) strictly prohibits their involvement in the social
                                    or political landscape of the
                                    country. China has established well-defined and succinct strategies, commonly
                                    referred to as "5-year plans," which have
                                    been in place since 1949 during the tenure of Chairman Mao and were first
                                    implemented in 1953. The plans presented
                                    provide a lucid perspective on the measures being undertaken by China. The
                                    objectives range from enhancing the economic
                                    landscape to establishing a stable sociopolitical framework within the Chinese
                                    state. The present course of action
                                    aligns with Marxist ideology, as China is strategically and incrementally
                                    implementing socialist policies in a period
                                    where socialism is precluded from attaining global dominance.
