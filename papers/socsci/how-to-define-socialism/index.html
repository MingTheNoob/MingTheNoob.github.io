                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>
                                Socialism has been the subject of diverse definitions since its inception. Regrettably, individuals in
                                positions of
                                power have utilised the term in a manner that aligns with their political agendas. As a result, a
                                plethora of
                                occurrences of anti-socialist propaganda have transpired throughout the annals of time, resulting in a
                                significant
                                number of individuals being misinformed regarding the authentic definition of socialism. The National
                                Socialist German
                                Workers' Party, commonly known as the Nazis, strategically adopted the term "socialist" into their party
                                name as a means
                                of gaining popular backing. However, once they ascended to power, they vehemently denounced socialists
                                and deemed them
                                as their primary adversaries. Likewise, the United States utilises the term socialism as a means of
                                vilifying its
                                opponents, with the aim of galvanising public sentiment and rationalising potential military
                                interventions. However, it
                                is noteworthy that both of these entities have inaccurately characterised socialism. Similar to several
                                other political
                                and economic terminologies, the definition of socialism fluctuates depending on one's perspective. The
                                variance in
                                viewpoints observed is not necessarily attributable to political leanings, but rather to the influence
                                of leftist
                                ideology. This is due to the fact that socialism, which is a leftist ideology, is not present within
                                right-wing economic
                                ideologies. This is contrary to popular misconceptions, particularly in the context of social
                                democracies.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Defining Leftism</h3>
                            <p>
                                In order to fully grasp the concept of socialism, it is imperative to first understand the
                                differentiation between
                                economic left-wing and right-wing ideologies. The prevalence of restrictive educational backgrounds
                                among individuals
                                has led to a common misinterpretation of the definitions of these terms. It is of paramount importance
                                to acknowledge
                                that the ideological orientations of leftism and rightism exhibit variability contingent upon the
                                particular domain of
                                inquiry, be it economics, sociology, or politics. The term socialism pertains to a social arrangement of
                                the economy,
                                thus the economic definition is the applicable one in this context. In isolation, socialism does not
                                provide any insight
                                into the nature of society or the social conduct of its members. Nevertheless, the economic structure of
                                a regime can
                                exert a substantial influence on its social fabric. A comprehensive understanding of socialism
                                necessitates a grasp of
                                the concepts of economic leftism and rightism.

                                Throughout history, the fundamental principles of economic leftism have remained consistent, resulting
                                in a certain
                                degree of homogeneity in its appearance over time. The term "leftism" may be considered a recent
                                addition to the lexicon
                                of political discourse, however, the underlying objective of economic leftism, which seeks to establish
                                an economy that
                                is both democratic and collectively managed, has a historical lineage predating the coining of the term.
                                The ideology of
                                economic leftism has historically prioritised the collective distribution of economic power, rather than
                                its
                                concentration among the upper echelons of the socioeconomic hierarchy.

                            <p>
                                The concept of economic rightism is readily definable; however, it is important to acknowledge that
                                throughout history,
                                economic rightism has manifested in diverse forms as the ruling class has endeavoured to preserve a
                                structure that
                                favours their interests, even if it necessitates the establishment of a novel system. Over the course of
                                the last few
                                millennia, the dominant classes of diverse societies have implemented a range of economic frameworks,
                                including but not
                                limited to feudalism, slavery, and capitalism. The fundamental tenet of right-wing economies is
                                predicated on the notion
                                that individuals labour for the benefit of the wealthy class, while the labourer is remunerated with a
                                nominal
                                proportion of the actual value of their work. This phenomenon is observable across the historical epochs
                                of feudalism,
                                slavery, and capitalism. Among the tripartite economic systems, capitalism affords the labourer the
                                highest degree of
                                retention of the value of their labour, albeit the magnitude of this proportion is conventionally
                                modest. Capitalism is
                                extolled in the western world for this particular rationale. It is imperative to avoid deception, as the
                                labourer
                                continues to be subject to exploitation. Despite the reduction in the extent of expropriation,
                                capitalism persists as a
                                right-leaning economic framework. This principle serves as the governing force behind all right-wing
                                economies.

                            <h3>What is Social Democracy?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Social democracy is a sociopolitical framework that is often categorised as a form of socialism. This
                                assertion is
                                untenable since socialism is fundamentally an economic paradigm. The term "social democracy" is
                                conventionally applied
                                to nations that exhibit social liberalism and progressivism, and possess a political framework that
                                facilitates the
                                realisation of democratic outcomes that are advantageous to the populace. Numerous nations, including
                                socialist states
                                such as Cuba and China, as well as those within the European Union, satisfy the aforementioned criteria.
                                It is
                                noteworthy that the nomenclature of social democracies is not extended to socialist states, as the term
                                is exclusively
                                reserved by the Western powers for nations that are in alignment with their most dominant states. It is
                                evident that two
                                regions characterised by markedly distinct economic structures, namely the European Union and China, may
                                both be
                                classified as social democracies. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that solely one of them can be
                                categorised as
                                socialist. The ideology of economic rightism enables the elite class to maintain their dominant status
                                and exert an
                                excessive degree of influence over societal and governmental affairs, beyond what may be deemed
                                appropriate for any
                                single individual. The coexistence of sociopolitical power and economic power within the wealthy class
                                has historically
                                enabled the utilisation of the former to maintain the latter's economic status. Social democracy is
                                focused on altering
                                the existing sociopolitical paradigm to promote greater equality for the average individual, while
                                socialism is
                                primarily concerned with modifying the economic mechanisms of a society to facilitate a more equitable
                                distribution of
                                wealth.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Defining Socialism</h3>
                            <p>
                                Having established socialism as an economic system, it is now imperative to delve further into its
                                nuances and examine
                                its manifestations across various systems. Given that economic leftism entails a democratic and
                                collectively managed
                                economy, it follows that all forms of economic leftism encompass socialism. In broad terms, socialism
                                can be
                                characterised by three distinct manifestations. The initial approach, commonly embraced by anarchists,
                                involves a
                                revolutionary uprising aimed at the immediate establishment of communism. In theoretical terms,
                                anarchists are inclined
                                to adopt a comprehensive or all-encompassing variant of socialism immediately after revolution. Marxist
                                ideology
                                advocates for the utilisation of socialism as a gradual and incremental mechanism to facilitate the
                                groundwork for the
                                eventual establishment of communism. Certain adherents of Marxist ideology seek to attain their
                                objectives through
                                insurrection, while others advocate for legislative reform as a means to achieve their goals. The
                                additional
                                distinctions between Marxism and anarchism, as well as between revolution and reformation, are deemed
                                extraneous to the
                                present discourse and will be expounded upon in a subsequent paper.
